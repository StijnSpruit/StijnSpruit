- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @StijnSpruit
- ğŸ‡³ğŸ‡± I'm from the Netherlands
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in backend development
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
  - flutter, for app development
  - Symfony, for developing website backends

- âš¡ Fun fact: i've tried to make an interpreted programming language in rust before. It's quite a hard thing to do but also pretty fun!
